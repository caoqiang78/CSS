syntax: nth-child(an + b)   nth-of-type(an + b)
        a is a number
        b is a number
        also can use: even and odd

<div>
  <h1> navList </h1>
  <p> first </p>
  <p> second </p>
  <p> third> </p>
</div>

For p:nth-child(2), it must satify (1) this should be <div>'s second child; and (2) this element must be <p>, 
    so the final selection is <p> first </p>;

For p:nth-of-type(2), from the sematic, it is nth of "type", so it should satisfy the second <p> element,
    so the final selection is <p> second </p>;
